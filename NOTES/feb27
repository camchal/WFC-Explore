ideas for backtracking: if a cell fails to collapse, then regenerate its neighbors. somehow re-roll those slots. 
I dont really know how this works though to be honest.

//get index of coordinate that failed, get index in cell array - find its neighbors, 
    if its neighbros are in a differnt region, then get that regions cells depending on cardinal direction

    see if i can reroll the genereration - this would be in accordance to its neighbors though, if there are no other rerolls
        or if there was a reroll, then move to the next neighbor - assuming that its generated. perhaps this back tracking is chain like?
    maybe it backtracks and regenerates areas multiple times? the question is how many times should back track fail before region
    is regenerated completely?
    plus i gotta figure out how to even re roll the cell. is the information stored? or can i get its neighbors characterisitcs
    and redo its possible tiles?

should i keep track of the backtracked cells and requeue their tiles to be updated in the animation queue? could be cool to see how the region changes
ofc each change should be added back to the regions independent animation queue

need to somehow fix the fucking proto_tileset. thats a must. although that tileset would probably be succeeding every single time
need to know why it works so well
